ICT\nMODERATOR: (As interpreted.) Today, on the occasion of the state visit to Vietnam by President Joe Biden, President of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, His Excellency Võ Văn Thưởng, solemnly hosts the banquet (inaudible) President Joe Biden and the high-level delegation of the United States of America.\nWe are very honored to invite your Excellency, President Võ Văn Thưởng, to deliver his welcome remarks.\nPRESIDENT THƯỞNG: (As interpreted.) Honorable President Joseph Biden, distinguished American and Vietnamese guests, on behalf of the state and people of Vietnam, once again, I would like to warmly welcome you, President Joseph Biden of the United States of America, to Vietnam on your first state visit.\nYour visit is truly significant. It builds on the very special character of Vietnam-U.S. relations. You are the first U.S. president to visit Vietnam at the invitation of the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, Nguyễn Phú Trọng.\nDuring this visit, you have also joined General Secretary Nguyễn Phú Trọng to announce the upgrade of relations to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership for peace, cooperation, and sustainable development. This is truly a new page in the relationship between our two countries — an enduring, stable long-term framework that opens up a vast space for further development of the bond between us for decades to follow.\nMr. President, distinguished guests, a mere five months after national independence, President Hồ Chí Minh penned a letter addressing President Truman, expressing the desire to establish a bond of full cooperation with the United States. As history would have it, this desire had to confront countless turmoil and challenges — all of such we have overcome. And today, we can speak with joy that never before has the relationship between our two countries reached such flourishing height as today.\nFrom former enemies to Comprehensive Strategic Partners, this is truly a model in the history of international relations as to how reconciliation and relationship-building should proceed after a war. This is a result of the efforts to walk past such challenges and vicissitudes of history by so many generations of our country’s leaders and people.\nOver the past 50 years, we have witnessed events of such significance in the relationship and the unprecedented quantum leaps in our relationship. There have been momentous achievements in various areas of cooperation between Vietnam and the U.S. — from economic, trade, investment ties and in education and training cooperation, to various mechanisms for dialogue and joint efforts across different domains and sectors.\nAcross the comprehensive areas of cooperation between us, I would like to specifically call to attention the truly pride-worthy and striking achievements in our cooperation in addressing war legacy issues.\nAllow me to cite the dioxin remediation projects in Da Nang and Bien Hoa airports; support given by the U.S. in various ways to Vietnamese persons with disabilities, including Agent Orange victims of the second and third generation; and the re- — and the removal of UXOs left behind after the war.\nAnd most recently, for the first time, our two countries have started working together to conduct forensic identification of yet unidentified remains of Vietnamese war martyrs. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to generations of U.S. administrations and people — and to you, Mr. President, and the First Lady, Dr. Jill Biden — for your active support for Vietnam in the humanitarian field.\nOn our part, since 1973, Vietnam has actively conducted unilateral searches for American MIAs. In 1988, both sides commenced the first joint mission. After half a century, the co- — the full cooperation between Vietnam and U.S. in this area is still growing stronger and stronger. Many American MIAs lost in high mountains or deep oceans, even the — on grounds hardly ever tread, have since been found — their remains returned to their home.\nMr. President, distinguished guests, to quote Secretary General Nguyễn Phú Trọng, “Set aside the past, overcome differences, build on similarities, look to the future.”\nYou have also pledged your support for a strong, independent, resilient, and prosperous Vietnam. I have a strong belief that building on the length of Vietnam-U.S. relations with mutual trust and respect, and given the new driver we have established during your visit, the Strategic — Comprehensive Strategic Partnership for peace, cooperation, and sustainable development between Vietnam and the U.S. will continue to grow in strength and substance and bring concrete benefits to our two peoples, make positive contributions to peace, friendship, cooperation and sustainable development in the region and the "

In Hanoi, Biden announced an increased partnership with Vietnam, a major relationship upgrade for the U.S. on Beijing’s doorstep. Geoff Bennett discussed the significance with Ted Osius.\nRead the Full Transcript\nGeoff Bennett:\nPresident Joe Biden just wrapped a whirlwind trip to Asia, first to New Delhi, where he met with leaders of the world's most powerful economies at the G20 Summit, then a historic trip to Vietnam, his first ever.\nBoth visits are seen as a further push by the Biden administration to counter China's influence in Asia and the wider developing world. In Hanoi, President Biden announced an increased partnership with Vietnam, a major relationship upgrade for the U.S., right on Beijing's doorstep.\nBut while speaking to reporters, the president cautioned this deal is not about containing China.\nJoe Biden, President of the United States:\nThat's what this trip is all about. Having India cooperate much more with the United States, be closer to the United States, Vietnam being closer to the United States, it's not about containing China. It's about having a stable base, a stable base in the Indo-Pacific.\nGeoff Bennett:\nTo discuss the significance of President Biden's trip to Vietnam and what it means for Washington's Beijing policy, we welcome former U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam Ted Osius. He's now president and CEO of the U.S.-ASEAN Business Council.\nWelcome back to the \"NewsHour.\"\nTed Osius, U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam:\nThank you very much. Great to be here.\nGeoff Bennett:\nThis partnership between the U.S. and Vietnam appears to be a diplomatic win-win, coming at a time when Vietnam is trying to flex a degree of independence from Beijing and as the U.S., as we mentioned, is looking for friends across the Indo-Pacific region.\nHow do you view it, especially in light of the long relationship, the long, really tortured relationship between the U.S. and Hanoi?\nTed Osius:\nWell, win-win is a good description of it.\nThe comprehensive partnership was established by President Truong Tan Sang and Barack Obama 10 years ago. And what has just happened is a major milestone, in that President Biden and Nguyen Phu Trong, the general secretary of the Communist Party, upgraded that relationship by two rungs.\nThey made it a comprehensive strategic partnership. In fact, it is comprehensive in nature and it's strategic already. And I think both countries are going to benefit a great deal from deepening this partnership, from accelerating our collaboration.\nGeoff Bennett:\nPresident Biden has made clear that his intention was not to start a cold war with China. That's how he put it, but the goal is to provide global stability by building U.S. relationships throughout Asia at a time of tensions with Beijing.\nPractically, though, how will China view that? Might they see this as a distinction without a difference?\nTed Osius:\nWell, possibly. There could be some blowback from China.\nBut if you look at the broader strategy that the Biden administration has adopted, they have created the Quad, a group of democracies. They have created AUKUS, which strengthens our position and those of our allies in the region. They have assembled a trilateral arrangement of Japan, Korea, and the United States.\nThey're working very hard to strengthen partnerships and alliances throughout the region. Vietnam is not a traditional ally and probably never will be. Neither is India, I would mention, where the president also visited. But they're partners. They're strong partners. Indonesia is another strong partner.\nWhenever we can strengthen these partnerships, friendships, and alliances in the region, it's good for the United States. And I would say that it's good for the entire region.\nGeoff Bennett:\nTo your point, in just the last five months, Biden has hosted the president of the Philippines at the White House. He lavished the Indian prime minister with a state dinner. He's hosted his counterparts the leaders of Japan and South Korea at that summit that was full of symbolism at Camp David.\nWhat is the U.S. presenting as the mutual interest as he meets with these leaders?\nTed Osius :\nWell, with all of them, economic engagement is very high on the list.\nThere are shared security interests as well, but they're looking beyond just traditional security concerns and looking at, how can we raise all boats? How can we achieve greater prosperity and stability in the Indo-Pacific?\nAnd so, to that point, what the president is saying is a"

He was at the G20 Summit in India, and is now wrapping up his trip to Vietnam.\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\nPresident Biden spent the weekend in Asia working to deepen cooperation with India and Vietnam. He was at a G20 summit in New Delhi, then made a stop in Hanoi. The subtext involved India's and Vietnam's northern neighbor, China.\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\nPRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: We're not looking to hurt China, sincerely. We're all better off if China does well - if China does well by the international rules.\nINSKEEP: NPR White House correspondent Asma Khalid has been traveling with the president. Hey there, Asma.\nASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Hi, Steve.\nINSKEEP: We'll tell people that you're now in Vietnam. What is the president's main mission there?\nKHALID: Well, Biden came here to Hanoi to formally forge deeper ties with Vietnam. Vietnam is now putting the United States in its highest diplomatic category. That's on par with China. And, Steve, this is really quite significant. Vietnam only places a few other countries in this top tier. And we heard President Biden describe this as being a historic moment that is overcoming a, quote, \"bitter past.\"\nThis new status is not just about an economic relationship, but I will say that trade and investment are key. The U.S. and Vietnam are working together to expand the Vietnamese semiconductor industry. And earlier today, Biden met with tech CEOs and business leaders here in Hanoi. You know, the U.S. is already Vietnam's largest export market, and that has only grown even bigger since the U.S. slapped tariffs on a bunch of Chinese goods a couple of years ago.\nINSKEEP: Well, if the United States is deepening relations with this neighbor of China that in some ways can economically rival China - in some ways, I should emphasize - how does that fit in to the president's broader message?\nKHALID: Well, the president yesterday in Hanoi repeatedly said he is not trying to hurt China. He's not trying to contain China. But, Steve, I think his actions suggest sort of otherwise on the containment front. I mean, he has been systematically building relationships with other countries in the Indo-Pacific region. He recently invited the leaders of Japan and South Korea to Camp David, where they announced this new era of trilateral cooperation and plans to expand their security ties. And he flew here to Hanoi from New Delhi. He was in India in part because this administration increasingly sees India as a counterbalance to China in the region.\nI will say that, you know, both India and Vietnam - these relationships are somewhat complicated because Biden came into office pledging to center human rights, and both India and Vietnam have been criticized on that issue. The White House says Biden has been candid about democracy and human rights, and he often does that with a degree of humility in private meetings.\nINSKEEP: How, if at all, did China come up at that G20 summit in New Delhi?\nKHALID: Well, I should point out that China's leader, Xi Jinping, did not attend the summit. And there was a sense that that in some ways created an opening for the United States to really take the lead on the agenda. There were two key proposals, and both seem to revolve around countering China. One was this plan to invest billions of dollars more into the World Bank to provide additional lending to low-income countries, and that was seen as an alternative to Chinese lending. The other big plan was this idea of a new, ambitious global infrastructure system that would create a shipping and rail corridor from India to the Middle East and onto Europe. And, of course, China has spent years pouring money into its own infrastructure projects in Asia and Africa through its \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative.\nINSKEEP: Asma, I'll note that it's 9/11, at least on this side of the international date line. How's the administration marking this date?\nKHALID: Well, other members of the administration will be at the sites that were attacked, but Biden himself will be in Anchorage, Alaska. We're told that he'll be joined by service members and their families to mark the date.\nYou know, Steve, I will say I am struck by the fact that for most of my life, the Middle East has been the primary foreign policy focus for multiple administrations. And I think it is noteworthy that this year, 22 years after the attacks, the president is on his way back from Asia, and China is now the primary foreign policy focus.\nINSKEEP: NPR's Asma Khalid, safe travels home.\nKHALID: Thanks, Steve.\nCopyright © 2023 NPR.\nAll rights reserved.\nVisit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\nNPR transcripts are created on a rush deadline by an NPR contractor.
