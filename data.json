    "Business applications of sentiment analysis\nHere are some important ways in which sentiment analysis helps brands monitor emerging trends and keep ahead of competitors to build brand reputation, enhance customer loyalty and stay ahead of competitors.\n\nMonitor industry trends\nBrands have to constantly keep up with changing industry trends and customer preferences. Sentiment analysis helps you monitor social and online chatter simultaneously from multiple platforms to track emerging trends across timelines. This enables you to be ahead of the curve and proactively improve your products and services for maximum return on investment (ROI).\n\nConduct competitive analysis\nSentiment analysis helps you examine conversations about competing brands to track their strengths and weaknesses and inform your business strategy. You also get market-gap insights so you can explore ways to capture new business. With Sprout, see a side-by-side competitor comparison of key performance metrics across social such as share of voice, engagement, impressions and user sentiment all in one place.\n\nScreenshot of Sprout Social\u2019s competitor analysis performance report showing metrics on various KPIs including topic summary, share of voice, total engagements and sentiment scores based on positive, negative and neutral emotions found in the data\n\nCreate engaging content\nCreate compelling content that resonates with your customers and outperforms your competitors. Analyzing sentiment in social listening and review data for hot topics enables you to build closer relationships with your audience with personalized content based on what they\u2019re actually talking about.\n\nNurture employee advocacy\nMaximize brand amplification and level up employee advocacy by automating the delivery of impactful content to employees, like Medallia did using Sprout. Use sentiment analysis to know what inspires audiences the most helps you build a holistic strategy to reach a bigger audience with automated content distribution.\n\nImprove brand reputation\nGet timely alerts on spikes in brand mentions so you know when there\u2019s an increase in online chatter about you and track the cause. Positive brand mentions like customer recommendations or praise are equally important to track as it enables you to reshare positive mentions to amplify your brand and build social proof.\n\nSimilarly, set alerts based on keywords or for a particular brand campaign to measure market sentiment and take necessary action based on your insights.\n\nTriage inbound messages\nQuickly identify incoming messages from frustrated or unhappy audience members so that customer care teams can prioritize accordingly and act swiftly. Sprout users on the Advanced Plan can tap into AI-powered sentiment in the Smart Inbox and Reviews Feed. Posts will automatically be assigned a positive, neutral, negative or unclassified value, making it seamless to isolate messages and even assign Automated Rules according to sentiment. \n",
